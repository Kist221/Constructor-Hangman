## Instructions

This is a node application, meaning you must run it from a terminal with [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

You must `cd` into the downloaded directory of this repo and run the command: `node CLI.js`.

You can type `exit` at any time in the game to exit. 

Feel free to adjust the game word options in the Random.js file.

**HINT:** All the answers are not always **black** and _white_... :D
